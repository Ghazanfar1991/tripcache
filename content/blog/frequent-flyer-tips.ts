If you're on a plane more often than you're at your desk, organization is your secret advantage. TripCache gives frequent flyers a streamlined toolkit for keeping flights, upgrades, and expense reports under control. Use these ten tips to travel smarter in 2025.

## 1. Automate Every Confirmation

Forward airline, lounge, and hotel confirmations to TripCache as soon as they arrive. Automation keeps your dashboard accurate and surfaces schedule conflicts early.

## 2. Track Elite Status Progress

Use tags like "Delta Medallion" or "oneworld Emerald" to group trips by loyalty program. Export a filtered CSV each quarter to see qualifying miles, segments, and spend.

## 3. Store Seat Preferences in Notes

Attach notes such as "Prefer 2A window" or "Order vegetarian meal" to recurring routes. Agents appreciate the context when you call for changes.

## 4. Keep Lounge Passes Handy

Upload PDF lounge invitations and one-time passes to the relevant trip. When you arrive at the airport, everything is accessible from your phone—even offline.

## 5. Monitor Connection Buffers

TripCache highlights tight layovers. Add a checklist item in the trip notes with alternative flights or backup lounges in case of delays.

## 6. Sync with Your Calendar

Export upcoming trips to your calendar so colleagues know when you're airborne. Block recovery time after red-eyes to avoid overbooking meetings.

## 7. Capture Receipts in Real Time

Snap photos of in-flight Wi-Fi receipts or airport meals and email them to TripCache. Everything attaches to the right segment, ready for your monthly expense report.

## 8. Plan Mileage Runs Strategically

Use the dashboard to spot gaps in your elite qualification goals. Search for inexpensive positioning flights and create tentative trips to compare cost per status point.

## 9. Share Itineraries with Family

Add trusted contacts to specific trips so they receive schedule updates. Peace of mind goes a long way when you're halfway around the world.

## 10. Review Monthly Insights

Generate a monthly CSV and filter by cabin class, carrier, or client. The data helps you negotiate travel budgets, request status matches, or justify premium cabin approvals.

## Bonus: Build a Travel Day Routine

- Check TripCache first thing to confirm gates and aircraft changes.
- Download entertainment, update offline maps, and confirm lounge hours.
- Use TripCache's notes section to jot down mileage crediting instructions for partner flights.
