## Welcome to TripCache!

If you're a frequent traveler tired of juggling multiple booking confirmations across different email threads, TripCache is here to transform how you manage your trips. In this guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to get started.

## Why TripCache?

Managing travel itineraries shouldn't be complicated. Whether you're a digital nomad, business traveler, or vacation enthusiast, keeping track of flights, hotels, and bookings can quickly become overwhelming. TripCache solves this by:

- **Automatically organizing** your travel confirmations
- **Centralizing** all your trip information in one place
- **Generating reports** for expense tracking and tax purposes
- **Syncing across devices** so your itineraries are always accessible

## Setting Up Your Account

Getting started with TripCache is incredibly simple:

1. **Sign up for free** - No credit card required, no trial period. TripCache is free forever.
2. **Get your unique email** - Upon signup, you'll receive a unique TripCache email address (e.g., `yourname@trips.tripcache.app`)
3. **Start forwarding** - Forward any booking confirmation to this address, and we'll handle the rest.

## The Email-to-Trip Magic

This is where TripCache truly shines. Our intelligent email parser can extract trip details from virtually any booking confirmation:

### Supported Booking Types
- ✈️ Flight confirmations (all major airlines)
- 🏨 Hotel reservations
- 🚗 Car rental bookings
- 🚂 Train tickets
- 🎫 Event tickets

### How It Works

Simply forward your booking email to your TripCache address. Our system will:

1. Parse the email content
2. Extract key details (dates, locations, confirmation numbers)
3. Create a beautifully formatted trip entry
4. Notify you when the trip is added

**Pro tip:** Set up an email filter to automatically forward confirmations from common booking sites!

## Manual Trip Entry

Prefer to add trips yourself? No problem! Our manual entry interface is designed for speed:

1. Click "Add Trip" in your dashboard
2. Fill in the essential details
3. Add optional notes or attachments

### Use Cases for Reports

- **Mileage tracking** - Monitor frequent flyer miles and loyalty points

### How to Generate a Report

1. Navigate to the Reports section
2. Select your date range
3. Choose which trip types to include
4. Click "Generate CSV"
5. Download and use in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet software
