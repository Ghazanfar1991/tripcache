On April 1, 2025, TripCase officially shut down, leaving millions of travelers searching for a reliable alternative. If you're one of the many users affected by this closure, you're probably wondering: **What's the best TripCase alternative?**

After extensive research and testing, we believe **TripCache** is the perfect replacement. Here's why.

## Why Did TripCase Shut Down?

TripCase, owned by Sabre Corporation, announced its sunset in early 2025. The decision came as part of Sabre's strategic restructuring, leaving users with little time to find alternatives. For years, TripCase was a trusted companion for business travelers and vacation planners alike, offering itinerary management and travel organization features.

## What Made TripCase Popular?

Before we dive into alternatives, let's understand what made TripCase so valuable:

- **Email forwarding** - Automatically parse booking confirmations
- **Centralized itineraries** - All trips in one place
- **Flight tracking** - Real-time updates and notifications
- **Document storage** - Keep boarding passes and confirmations handy
- **Expense tracking** - Generate reports for business travel

## Introducing TripCache: The Modern TripCase Alternative

TripCache was built specifically to address the gap left by TripCase's closure. We've taken everything users loved about TripCase and made it better, faster, and completely free.

### Key Features That Make TripCache Stand Out

**1. Email-to-Trip Automation**

Just like TripCase, TripCache gives you a unique email address. Forward any booking confirmation, and our AI-powered parser extracts all the details automatically. But unlike TripCase, our parser is more accurate and supports more booking platforms.

**2. Comprehensive Document Storage**

Store boarding passes, visas, passports, and travel documents all in one secure location. Our document management system is more intuitive than TripCase ever was.

**3. CSV Export for Expense Tracking**

Generate detailed CSV reports of your travel history - perfect for expense reimbursement and tax documentation. This feature alone has saved our users countless hours.

**4. Beautiful, Modern Interface**

TripCache features a stunning gradient-based design with dark and light modes. The interface is cleaner and more intuitive than TripCase's dated design.

**5. Completely Free Forever**

Unlike TripCase, which had premium tiers, TripCache is 100% free with no hidden costs or premium features locked behind paywalls.

## How TripCache Compares to Other Alternatives

### TripCache vs TripIt

While TripIt is the most popular TripCase alternative, it has limitations:

- **TripIt Pro costs $49/year** - TripCache is free
- **Limited document storage** - TripCache offers unlimited storage
- **No CSV exports** - TripCache includes comprehensive reporting

### TripCache vs Wanderlog

Wanderlog is great for vacation planning but lacks features for business travelers:

- **No email forwarding** - Manual entry only
- **Limited expense tracking** - Not suitable for business travel
- **Focused on leisure travel** - TripCache serves all travelers

### TripCache vs Folio Wallet

Folio Wallet is a newer alternative but has drawbacks:

- **Mobile-only** - TripCache works on web and mobile
- **Limited automation** - Manual entry required for most bookings
- **Smaller user base** - Fewer integrations and support
